Node JS is basically a way to run javascript outside the context of the browser.

CommonJS is what the people at Node decided to use as there Module loader. So
using the require() we can get access to built in and 3rd party npm modules.

Using the exports object on module we can expose our code to be required later.
To execute node against a file we can run node/path/to/file

//config.js
exports.setup = function() {};
exports.enable = function() {};
exports.ready = function() {};

// otherfile.js
module.exports = {
  action: function() {},
  trigger: true
}

<!-- Express
-------------------------->
Express is a framework that sits on top of Node, and uses the HTTP module to
make building servers in Node not so hard.
