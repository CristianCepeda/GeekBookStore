helpful in better understanding on how to use Git. 
=======
<!-- Express Notes
-------------------------->
- Express will handle your backend routes whereas
React (with react-router) will handle frontend routes.

- server.get() is getting data. and then it responds with the data.
- server.post() is actually sending data to the server.
- server.put() is basically an update. If you have something in your system and
you want to update it, then you can do this particular method.
- server.delete() is once you have data in your system, and you want to delete
it, then delete command here is the way to do so.

<!-- Mongoose
-------------------------->
Mongoose is basically a library to help us with modeling our database and bring
several built in tools to help us with validation, business logic, hooks,
et cetera.

<!-- MongoDB
-------------------------->
- In your CLI under the first tab run
  - mongod
    - To run MongoDB
    
- Under the second tab run
  - mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017
    - This is to run a mongo shell on the same host machine as the mongod. Use
    the --host command line option to specify the localhost address and port
    that the mongod listens on:


<!-- RESTful API
-------------------------->
- RESTful API is a way to transact with a backend using HTTP transactions.
- We use a series of calls like GET,POST,PUT, and DELETE with an HTML address
to transact with our backend and its data.
- Example we use GET calls to pull the data from the backend. If we need to add
new data then, we use POST. If we need to update data, we use PUT. And finally
DELETE. Well if you need to delete data.

<!-- ES6
-------------------------->
Template strings ex. res.send(`Node and express server is running on port ${PORT}`)

<!-- Git Workflows
-------------------------->
- Great read on forms of Git Workflow. There are other links that can be
helpful in better understanding on how to use Git.

<!-- package.json dependencies
-------------------------->
- Nodemon is basically a package that allows us to refresh the server
automatically whenever you make changes to your server as opposed to have to
shut it down and start it over to see your changes.


<!-- Creating Mock Data
-------------------------->
For reference we can use this to create fake data. Maybe take a look into it and
see if it might be useful.
